# myJsPromiseImpl
my own js promise implementation just for fun

NOTE: not 100% Promise/A specification since i passed the child deferred object to the Promise using the then()'s 3rd param which is not part of the spec

Also wrote a blog explaining the way I implement this step by step.  https://vcfvct.wordpress.com/2016/05/25/write-my-own-small-promise/
